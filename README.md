## Magic Eye 
Magic Eye is a desktop application that utilizes the openCV library and YOLOv8 algorithms for basic operations such as object detection, segmentation, and face recognition.

### Getting Started
1. First, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FranciszekCieslik/python_openCV_YOLOv8.git
    ```

2. Then, navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python_openCV_YOLOv8
    ```

3. Run the script to install the required libraries:
  
   Some of the libraries require `CMake`
   
    ```bash
    chmod +x lib_installer.sh
    ./lib_installer.sh
    ```

4. Finally, launch the Magic Eye application:
    ```bash
    chmod +x magiceye.py
    python3 magiceye.py
